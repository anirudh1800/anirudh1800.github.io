#### Hi! I'm Anirudh. I am full stack java developer, juggler of different tools/API's and passionate about the whole process of software development. I did Master's in Computer Science from Arizona State University, specialising in Distributed Software Development and Security. Currently, I am working as a consultant in a major financial organisation. During free time, I learn new and upcoming cool stuff and spend quality time in writing articles. Feel free to email [ gali.anirudh@gmail.com] if any help needed in any project.
